# Warehouse Fulfillment Application

## Overview
This application is a warehouse fulfillment tool for ship.jerky.com, integrating with Shopify to manage orders. It provides a streamlined interface for warehouse staff to search orders, view details, and handle fulfillment tasks. The design is adapted from the `jerky_top_n_web` theme, focusing on readability and efficiency in a warehouse environment. It aims to improve order processing and inventory management through real-time synchronization and a user-friendly interface. Key capabilities include: streamlined order management, real-time visibility into SkuVault wave picking sessions, efficient historical order backfill, comprehensive reporting, a print queue system for shipping labels, and real-time updates via WebSockets for order status. The project's ambition is to enhance order processing efficiency and accuracy for ship.jerky.com.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design System**: Warm earth-tone palette from `jerky_top_n_web`, large typography for warehouse readability.
- **UI Components**: `shadcn/ui` (New York style variant) built on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (Vite), Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state management.
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js and TypeScript, RESTful API, Drizzle ORM for database interactions.
- **Authentication**: Passwordless via magic link tokens (email), secure HTTP-only session cookies.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless connection, Drizzle Kit for migrations. Schema includes tables for users, authentication, orders (Shopify and ShipStation data), products, and product variants.
- **Core Features**:
    - **Product Catalog**: Synchronized via Shopify webhooks, warehouse-optimized interface.
    - **SkuVault Sessions**: Displays wave picking sessions from SkuVault using a reverse-engineered API with manual authentication, advanced search, filtering, and detailed session views. Includes token caching and rate limiting.
    - **Order Backfill System**: Fault-tolerant task-based architecture for importing historical Shopify orders and ShipStation shipments. Creates daily fetch tasks (2 per day: Shopify + ShipStation) queued in Redis, processed by dedicated backfill-fetch-worker. Features per-source progress tracking (shopifyFetchCompleted/Failed, shipstationFetchCompleted/Failed) with atomic dual-counter updates preventing drift. Includes comprehensive observability with real-time WebSocket updates, heartbeat system, stage tracking, stuck job detection, manual cancellation, intelligent rate limiting (500ms Shopify, 1.5s ShipStation), jobId correlation for downstream error tracking, and per-order error isolation. UI displays overall fetch progress with per-source breakdown.
    - **Background Worker**: Asynchronous webhook processor with mutex-based concurrency control.
    - **Shipment Sync Worker**: Dual-path asynchronous processor for enriching shipment data from ShipStation, handling tracking numbers and order numbers. Triggered by ShipStation webhooks when shipments are created or updated. **Webhook Optimization**: Treats ShipStation webhooks as patch operations by using inline webhook payload data directly, eliminating API calls for fulfillment and tracking updates during normal operation. Fulfillment webhooks (FULFILLMENT_V2) extract complete shipment data from webhook body; tracking webhooks (API_TRACK) use embedded tracking events to update shipment status. Orphaned tracking updates (no order number) are intelligently routed to DLQ rather than making API calls. API calls preserved only for backfill and manual sync operations. Includes fast-path optimization for existing order-linked shipments, unified status normalization, terminal status protection, structured DLQ error logging, and single-point dedupe cleanup. Features intelligent rate limit handling: 429 errors trigger automatic message requeue (with in-flight removal before enqueue to avoid dedupe blocking), wait for rate limit reset (using X-Rate-Limit-Reset header), and comprehensive fallback to DLQ if requeue fails. Prevents all message loss scenarios via removedFromInflight flag and precise processedCount tracking. Shipments can exist independently of orders to handle multi-channel orders.
    - **Shopify Order Sync Worker**: Fire-and-forget order import system triggered when shipments arrive for missing orders. Runs in background with atomic deduplication.
    - **Normalized Shipment Data**: Shipment items and tags are normalized into dedicated `shipment_items` and `shipment_tags` tables for efficient querying and partial fulfillment tracking. Includes batch migration, N+1 query prevention, type safety, and automatic population.
    - **ShipStation Customer Data Extraction**: Customer shipping information from ShipStation's `ship_to` field is extracted into dedicated database columns for multi-channel order support.
    - **Order Number Field**: Customer-facing order numbers (e.g., "JK3825345229") extracted from ShipStation's `shipment_number` field into dedicated `order_number` column. Provides consistent multi-channel order tracking regardless of whether order exists in Shopify database. Includes automatic extraction in all webhook paths (full-sync and fast-path), and historical backfill (824/1,430 shipments populated). UI displays order number for both linked and unlinked shipments.
    - **Order Date Field**: ShipStation shipment creation timestamps extracted from `createDate` field into dedicated `order_date` column, separate from database insertion time (`created_at`). Captures actual shipment/label creation time for accurate reporting and analytics. Includes automatic extraction in all webhook paths (full-sync and fast-path with multi-level fallback), and historical backfill (866/1,489 shipments populated, 58.2%).
    - **Enriched Shipment Data**: Comprehensive shipment metadata extracted from ShipStation webhooks into dedicated columns including return status (`is_return`), gift information (`is_gift`, `notes_for_gift`), customer notes (`notes_from_buyer`), total weight (concatenated value+unit), and all 26 `advanced_options` fields (billing details, special handling flags like `contains_alcohol`, `saturday_delivery`, `non_machinable`, custom fields, etc.). Automatic extraction in all webhook paths, fast-path preservation via partial updates, and historical backfill (824/1,430 shipments populated). UI displays badges for return/gift status, special handling flags, weight, and highlights gift messages and buyer notes.
    - **Shipments Page**: Shipment-centric warehouse interface displaying all shipments with proper SQL LEFT JOIN to orders table, handling shipments without order linkage gracefully. Features 3-column grid layout optimized for warehouse operations: **Left Column** (customer info) - customer name (text-2xl, most important), order number (text-lg), order date/time, contact info (text-sm); **Middle Column** (shipping details) - address, status description + carrier/service, items count, weight, tracking number, tags; **Right Column** (actions) - View Details button, status badges. All data loads immediately including tags and items for quick scanning. Displays status description integrated with shipping method ("Shipment created via USPS usps_ground_advantage"), return/gift badges, special handling indicators (Saturday delivery, contains alcohol), gift messages, and buyer notes. Includes collapsible items table, orphaned shipment detection, advanced filters (Status, Sub Status, Warehouse Status, Carrier, Date Range, Orphaned/Without Orders), and manual sync button. Advanced filters include shipmentStatus filter with support for null values (displayed as "No Status") using "null" string sentinel for database filtering. Manual sync fetches last 7 days of shipments from ShipStation V2 API and enqueues them in the shipment sync queue for processing. Navigation to shipment details via dedicated "View Details" button. Uses dual-ID routing strategy (shipmentId ?? id) for seamless navigation with ShipStation IDs or database UUIDs.
    - **Shipment Details Page**: Warehouse-optimized detail view with two-column layout showing comprehensive shipment metadata. Header displays tracking number, order number, and status badges. Customer section shows name, contact info, and full address. Shipping section shows carrier, service, weight, dates, and label access. Special instructions section highlights gift messages and buyer notes. Items table with product images, SKUs, quantities, and prices. Includes copy-to-clipboard for tracking numbers and direct label printing access. Supports dual-ID routing (accepts both ShipStation IDs and database UUIDs in URL).
    - **Dual-ID Routing**: All shipment-related API endpoints (/api/shipments/:id, /api/shipments/:id/items, /api/shipments/:id/tags) support dual lookup - attempting ShipStation shipmentId first, falling back to database UUID. Frontend consistently uses `shipmentId ?? id` for navigation and queries, ensuring seamless operation regardless of ID type. Backend routes resolve both ID types to database UUID for storage layer operations.
    - **Reports Page**: Business analytics dashboard with date range filtering, interactive charts, and metrics aligned to Central Standard Time.
    - **Operations Dashboard**: Real-time queue monitoring (Shopify webhook queue, Shipment sync queue, Shopify order sync queue), worker status, backfill job status, Shopify credentials validation, safe webhook re-registration, and data health metrics via WebSockets. Provides interactive failures tables and purge actions.
    - **Print Queue System**: Manages shipping label printing workflow with real-time status updates via WebSockets.
    - **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket server provides live order updates, queue status, and notifications.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Client, server, and shared code co-located.
- **Async Product Bootstrap**: Products synchronize asynchronously on server startup.

### System Design Choices
- **Webhook Configuration**: Environment-aware webhook registration for development and production, supporting independent webhook delivery and automatic rollback on failure.
- **Webhook Environment Isolation**: Automatic orphaned webhook cleanup on startup prevents dev/prod webhook duplication.
