🚚 MVP Overview for Ship. — Updated Version for Management (with Packing Stations)

Ship. is the new brain that decides how every single order ships before it ever touches ShipStation or SkuVault.

This eliminates our current maze of tags, manual decisions, and tribal knowledge.
The result is: consistent shipping, faster fulfillment, lower costs, and far less human dependency.

Ship. does three major things:

⸻

1. Ship. Automatically Decides Packaging, Carrier, and Service

Ship. learns how to ship each type of order through a simple cycle:

A) Every product belongs to a “collection.”

Examples:
	•	“2.5oz jerky”
	•	“8x8x3 gift box”
	•	“10-pack meat sticks”

Collections define:
	•	Size
	•	Shape
	•	Weight
	•	Packing behavior

This prevents SKU-level chaos.

⸻

B) Every order generates a “footprint.”

A footprint is just Ship.’s way of saying:

“What shape is this order based on the collections inside it?”

Example:
“2 gift boxes + 5 small jerky bags”

If Ship. recognizes the footprint, it instantly knows the packaging.
If not, it asks a human once and learns that as a permanent rule — a model.

⸻

C) Carrier + service are chosen automatically each time

Ship. runs a rate check and picks the lowest-cost service that still meets the customer’s promise.

⸻

D) Ship. handles temporary and permanent product/packaging changes

Both collections and packaging types can be:
	•	Active
	•	Inactive (temporarily unavailable)
	•	Retired

If something goes out of stock, Ship. gracefully adapts without breaking models or flooding the system with new footprints.

When it comes back?
Ship. can offer to revert old decisions.

Warehouse chaos becomes warehouse stability.

⸻

2. Ship. Manages Order Status, Holds, Changes, and Inventory Readiness

Ship. includes tools for:
	•	Customer service holds
	•	Out-of-stock holds
	•	Cancelations
	•	Address updates
	•	Manual carrier overrides
	•	Activity log per order

Only orders that are fully ready move into sessioning.

This ensures clean sessions and smooth picking.

⸻

3. Ship. Builds Sessions — With Packing Stations as the First Filter

A session is a group of 28 orders placed on a cart (because that’s what the carts hold).

But here’s the key:

Sessions are NOT created blindly. Ship. sorts them by packing station first.

We have three packing stations:

1. Boxing Machine
	•	Only for orders that use 12x12x8 boxes
	•	Fully automated packing
	•	High throughput
	•	Zero decision-making at the station

2. Poly Bag Station
	•	Only for orders that fit in 16x18 poly bags
	•	Very fast manual station
	•	Standardized packing motions

3. Hand Pack Station
	•	Anything that doesn’t fit in Box 1 or Poly Bag 1
	•	Custom boxes
	•	Mixed orders
	•	Odd-sized items
	•	Heavier or fragile orders

⸻

SESSION STEP 1 — Station Routing

Before anything else, Ship. sorts orders into these three streams:
	•	“Boxing Machine sessions”
	•	“Poly Bag sessions”
	•	“Hand Pack sessions”

That way, each cart goes to the correct physical location in the warehouse automatically.

This alone increases throughput and eliminates misrouted carts.

⸻

SESSION STEP 2 — Smart Sessioning™️ (Inside Each Station)

NOW Ship. builds optimized sessions within each lane.

Examples:

Boxing Machine Sessions
	•	All single gift boxes
	•	All 12x12x8 sets
	•	Very clean, very fast throughput

Poly Bag Sessions
	•	All single item jerky orders
	•	All lightweight small-bag orders
	•	Identical motions → high speed

Hand Pack Sessions
	•	All oversized stick orders
	•	All mixed multiple-box orders
	•	All bulky gift bundles
	•	Fragile or special-handling orders

Each group of 28 orders is purpose-built so picking and packing move like muscle memory.

⸻

THE RESULT

Ship. transforms fulfillment into a lane-based, high-efficiency flow:
	•	Orders get the right packaging automatically
	•	They get routed to the correct packing station automatically
	•	They get grouped into ultra-efficient sessions automatically
	•	ShipStation becomes a simple label printer
	•	SkuVault gets clean data for picking

This reduces labor, errors, training time, and costs — dramatically.

It also makes the entire warehouse predictable, scalable, and cleanly organized, even when suppliers run out of materials or products shift temporarily.
