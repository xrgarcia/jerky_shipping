In ShipStation API v2, checking rates is primarily handled through the Rates and Shipments endpoints. Unlike some legacy systems, these calls are designed to be non-destructive.The API CallsThere are two main ways to retrieve rates in v2 depending on whether you have a pre-existing shipment object.ActionEndpointMethodUse CaseGet Rates for Existing Shipment/v2/shipments/{shipment_id}/ratesGETUse this if you have already created a shipment and want to see carrier costs for it.Rate Shop / Estimate/v2/ratesPOSTBest for "just-in-time" rating. You pass the dimensions/destination in the body to get a list of options.Quick Estimate/v2/rates/estimatePOSTProvides a ballpark figure with minimal data (e.g., just zip codes and weight).Does checking rates change the shipment?No. Checking rates is a read-only or calculation-only operation. It does not modify the shipment record in the ShipStation database.However, there are a few technical nuances you should be aware of:Statelessness: When you call /v2/rates, the data you send (weight, dimensions, address) is used only for that specific calculation. It does not "save" over the existing data of a shipment unless you specifically follow up with a PUT request to the /v2/shipments endpoint.The rate_id Persistence: When you retrieve rates for a specific shipment_id, ShipStation generates a rate_id. This ID is a temporary pointer to a specific carrier quote. While the shipment itself doesn't change, these rate_ids are typically short-lived and may expire or become invalid if the shipment details are modified later.Executive Summary for Managers: You can safely run rate-shopping logic in parallel or as a "pre-flight" check for your users without worrying about corrupting order data or locking records. It is a "pure" function in terms of side effects.RecommendationIf you are building a checkout experience or a custom shipping UI, use /v2/rates. It gives you the most granular control over the data being quoted without needing to manage a persistent shipment object first.
